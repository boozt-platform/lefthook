# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover any security vulnerabilities in our project, we appreciate your responsible disclosure. To report a security issue, please avoid creating public GitHub issues. Instead, email us directly at security@boozt.com. We kindly request that you refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by our team.

We prioritize vulnerabilities present only in the latest version of our product. This helps us focus on addressing the most relevant security concerns and minimizing noise.

We take security seriously and are committed to promptly addressing and resolving any reported vulnerabilities. Thank you for helping us maintain the security and integrity of our project.
